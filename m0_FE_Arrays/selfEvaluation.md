<!-- # Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
Not very confident. I remembering struggling with for loops when I was learning on my own and then everything after for loop was confusing.But I seem to getting it bettter this time but would love for others to explain what each thing means when written out. This was tough. Took me a lot longer to complete because we didn't go over it in class.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum 
- how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I would prefer to have gone over for loops in class rather than if and else statements. I think if else is a lot easier to grasp than for loops and statements and combing if..in... for...in and other functions like charAt(), count(). This is definitely something I suggest you should go over in class/live.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
A lot more with understanding the syntax. And actually how to use it comfortably. I hope we can practice more in class with for loops.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I would love for you to go over and write what each code is saying for the challenges? So that I can make sure I am undestanding it correctly.
 
I get very confused when it's a string array, and I'm using for statements where i = 0, i < 10 ; i++... I don't know if i is the string array variable or if it's the position. I've gathered it's more of the position, and starting counter. But it gets confusing for me.
