// 1. Write a method or function that 
// determines how much a person will [pay in 
// taxes in the United States]
// (https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2022) 
// based on their annual income. The method or function 
// should accept a number representing the individual's annual income 
// as an argument and return the amount they will owe in taxes for that year.

// **overall goal**
